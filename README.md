# Learning about Version Control
author: Stephanie Ta

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

I really like how version control allows me to see and track the specific changes that I've made to different files.
With version control, I find it frustrating when files exist that are not necessary to push to the remote repository such as .ipynb_checkpoints and I am confused with how exactly a .gitignore file tells Git to ignore the specified files and folders.
